# Garg Internship Assignment (React Native)

Hi and welcome to the Garg internship home assignment. 

Before we begin, let's familiarize ourselves with the technologies that we will be using in the test.


### Technologies Used

1. [React Native](https://developers.google.com/amp) - State-of-the-art component library for building performant web pages

2. [Typescript](https://nextjs.org/)- Leading web-application development framework

Additionally, we are using Native Base for our UI Components. On top, it would be nice to have familiarity with `yarn`, `expo`, and `react`.

## Setting up

Follow the following steps

1. Clone this repo on your local machine. Read the [how to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-clone) if you aren't sure.
2. Make sure `yarn` is installed. You can find the installation guide at [Yarn's webpage](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
3. Execute the following command in the directory
   ```bash 
   # make sure to `cd <project-directory>` before running the command
   yarn install
   ```
4. Next, ensure that there is a device/emulator to run the app on 

   Please connect a device or create an emulator (https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator).
   Then follow the instructions here to enable USB debugging:
   https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html#developer-device-options
5. Finally, start the app 
   ```bash 
   # in the same project-directory
   yarn android
   ```
  
  ```bash
   # if you are on a mac
   yarn ios
  ```

   From here, you should be able to follow the instructions in the device to see the app in action

## Assignment

In the assignment, we would like you to carry out two subtasks.

### Subtask 1

Allow the user to capture an image when they click on the `Camera` button on the `Home` screen.

### Subtask 2

Create a listview of the captured images and display them in the `Images` screen.
The list view must comprise a thumbnail of the image and the timestamp.

## Submission

There are multiple ways you may submit your code.

1. Create a `private` Github repository and give us access to the page. This option is preferred
2. Mail a zipped folder of the project to us
3. Please ensure that the app runs without any errors. Warnings are fine :)
